#### _For [Dr.Suanda's](https://psych.uconn.edu/faculty/umay-suanda/) Communication and Development lab_

## Word Processing

#### Given two directories of transcripts:
    1.This counts up the occurance of each word, across each directory.
    2.For each directory, a dataframe is generated and saved as a `.csv`

Then it will combine the two dataframes into a larger dataframe (work in progress).

Within Dr.Suanda's lab, this is for comparing words in picture books to speech data from our studies.
